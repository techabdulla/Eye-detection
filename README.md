# Eye-detection
The problem of eye detection in face images is very important for a large number of applications ranging from face recognition to gaze tracking.
In this app . we propose a new algorithm for eyes detection that uses iris geometrical information for determining in the whole image 
the region candidate to contain an eye, and then the symmetry for selecting the eyes.
